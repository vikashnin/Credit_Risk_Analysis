# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis:

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I will oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I will use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Then, compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once I am done I will evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results
### 1.Naive Random Oversampling
